    "KITT is a remotely controlled vehicle. To allow for this remote control, a wireless link must be used.\n",
    "Over this wireless link, control commands can be sent from the base station (your computer) to KITT.\n",
    "This wireless link also facilitates requests for data from KITT and KITTâ€™s data in response to these\n",
    "requests.\n",
    "This project requires you to maneuver KITT in all sorts of ways. In this module, you will set up a\n",
    "connection to KITT and work with basic controls to allow for more advanced actions later on.\n",
    "This module starts with an assignment to get to know your team, set up your development environment,\n",
    "and start working with the car.\n",
