# Introduction to IP3: Autonomous Driving Challenge

In this course, you and your team will take a remotely operated electric toy car and make it drive autonomously. The car called ''KITT'' can communicate to a base station (your computer) via Bluetooth and has a pair of distance (anti-collision) sensors and an audio beacon on top. During a final competition, you are asked to demonstrate your achievements in several ''tasks'', i.e., races of increasing difficulty. All of which will be explained further in detail in the form of modules and snippets of code to aid each task.

## Modules

The overall goal of the project is to take a standard toy car with added functionality so that it can be remotely operated, can detect obstacles in front of it, and can communicate with a base station (your PC), which performs calculations such as location estimation, trajectory tracking, and collision avoidance. All of these functionalities needs to be described clearly along with proper documentation and analyse results. 

The modules are as follows, 

1. Communicating with KITT. (Modules 1 and 2)
2. Localization using microphones. (Module 3)
3. Path planning and System integration. (Modules 4 and 5)

Division of tasks can be done according to the communication with KITT and developing the localization algorithm. Now as the TDOA algorithm needs to be introduced as well, it would be best if some initial concepts are introduced.
